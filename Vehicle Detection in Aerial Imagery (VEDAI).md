# Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery (VEDAI) 

VEDAI is a dataset for Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery, provided as a tool to benchmark automatic target recognition algorithms in  unconstrained environments. The vehicles contained in the database, in  addition of being small, exhibit different variabilities such as  multiple orientations, lighting/shadowing changes, specularities or  occlusions. Furthermore, each image is available in several spectral  bands and resolutions.
